My NixOS setup. [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) for windows,
[DankMaterialShell](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell) for
the bar/launcher/notifications, and a wallpaper-matching color theme that's
gone a little too far - it's in the editors, the login screen, GRUB, Wine's
dialog boxes. Change your wallpaper and basically everything on the machine
recolors itself to match. Rounded corners and blur on top because it's 2026
and we deserve nice things.

Written with [flake-parts](https://flake.parts/) and
[import-tree](https://github.com/vic/import-tree), which just means: every
`.nix` file under `modules/` gets picked up automatically. No import list to
maintain, no forgetting to wire a new file in. Drop a file in the right
folder and it works - see [Extending it](#extending-it).

> [!WARNING]
> **This is my actual laptop's config, not a template you can just run.**
> `modules/hosts/Diablo/` has my real disk UUIDs and GPU IDs baked in. Clone
> this and rebuild without changing anything and your machine **will not
> boot** - it'll go looking for hardware that isn't there. Totally fine to
> build on top of, just read
> [Using this on your own machine](#using-this-on-your-own-machine) first.

## Features

**Desktop**
- **niri**, wired up through
  [nix-wrapper-modules](https://github.com/BirdeeHub/nix-wrapper-modules)
  instead of home-manager's built-in module, because I wanted the whole
  compositor config - keybinds, layout, window rules - in one file I can
  actually read top to bottom.
- **DankMaterialShell** does the bar, launcher (`Mod+A`/`Mod+S`), clipboard,
  notifications, lock screen, and a wallpaper carousel that drives the
  color theme for basically everything else.
- A custom **SDDM** login screen and a **GRUB** theme (an orange/purple
  wave pattern, generated at build time), both matched to the same cursor
  as the desktop. Yes, I theme the boot loader. No regrets.
- Terminal: kitty + zsh with the usual plugins, plus fastfetch showing a
  random logo every time you open a shell, just to keep things interesting.

**Development**
- Three editors - **VS Code**, **Android Studio**, **Zed** - set up with my
  actual extensions and settings, pinned as real Nix packages instead of
  "trust me, install these 40 things by hand."
- Seven **language toggles** (C/C++, Rust, Kotlin, Dart+Flutter, Nix, Qt,
  Python). Flip one on and it installs that language's tooling *and* tells
  all three editors which of their own extensions to grab for it. Flip it
  off and everything related vanishes from every editor - no leftover
  extensions for languages I don't even have installed anymore. Details in
  [docs/core.md](docs/core.md#modulescoredevlanguagesnix).
- [Free Claude Code](https://github.com/Alishahryar1/free-claude-code) runs
  quietly in the background so Claude Code (CLI, VS Code, Android Studio)
  can talk to a free-tier model instead of burning through the paid API.
  Needs one free API key to set up, see
  [docs/apps-development.md](docs/apps-development.md#modulesappsdevelopmentfreeclaudecodefreeclaudecodenix).

**Gaming**
- Steam, Lutris + Heroic, GE-Proton, gamescope presets, and a MangoHud
  overlay that doesn't look like it's from 2015. Even Steam, Heroic,
  Vesktop, and Wine's ugly native dialogs get color-matched. I said it went
  too far and I meant it.

**Everything else**
- Nautilus, Zen Browser (locked down, no telemetry nonsense), Spicetify,
  Bitwarden, a small dev-tools bundle, and Vesktop - all opt-in per
  machine, all under `modules/apps/`.
- ASUS ROG stuff: a bar widget
  ([DankAsusControl](https://github.com/shazzaam7/DankAsusControl)) for
  switching power profiles and GPU mode without alt-tabbing to a terminal.

## Prerequisites

- NixOS (installed, or the live ISO) with flakes turned on - or just add
  `--extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'` to every command
  below.
- UEFI boot. The GRUB config assumes it.

---

## Quick start (on the reference machine's exact hardware)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aayush2622/Vayori-Rice.git vayori
cd vayori
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#Diablo
```

> [!NOTE]
> Any user without a `hashedPassword` set logs in with `changeme` the first
> time. Run `passwd` right after and forget I told you that.

---

## Secrets

A handful of small credentials (an NVIDIA NIM API key for Free Claude
Code, a WakaTime key for Zed/VS Code/Android Studio, a Bitwarden CLI
email) live in one plain text file:
`~/.config/vayori/session/secrets.env`. It gets seeded with placeholder
values on first rebuild - just open it and fill in the real ones:

```bash
$EDITOR ~/.config/vayori/session/secrets.env
```

No encryption layer, no keypair to generate or lose. These aren't
high-stakes secrets (a self-hosted proxy token, a time-tracking key, an
email address), and the file already lives somewhere that's never
committed to git and has its own backup story - see below - so a whole
extra layer for them wasn't buying much.

Actual login sessions (Zen Browser, Vesktop, VS Code/Zed accounts, rbw,
Bitwarden desktop, Free Claude Code's `.env`) - and that same
`secrets.env` - all get symlinked into one fixed folder,
`~/.config/vayori/session`, automatically on every rebuild, regardless
of where this repo happens to be checked out. So that one folder is the
only thing that ever needs to move for a fresh install to come back
already logged into everything. Copy it directly (`cp -r`) for a
same-trust move, or use a password-encrypted archive for anywhere less
trusted:

```bash
vayori-app-state backup ~/vayori-session.enc    # on the old machine
vayori-app-state restore ~/vayori-session.enc   # on the new one
```

Full mechanism is in
[docs/core.md](docs/core.md#modulescoreusersnix) (what's in
`secrets.env` and how each app reads it) and
[docs/apps-utils.md](docs/apps-utils.md#modulesappsutilsstatebackupstatebackupnix)
(the session folder + CLI).

## Using this on your own machine

A host is just **two files** under `modules/hosts/<name>/`: `Host.nix`
(everything - users, apps, timezone, bootloader) and `_hardware.nix` (your
disks and GPU, basically `hardware-configuration.nix` with a different
name). Nothing else in the repo cares which machine it's running on.

> [!TIP]
> `_hardware.nix` starts with an underscore on purpose. `import-tree`
> auto-imports everything under `modules/` *except* paths containing `/_`,
> so this stays a plain NixOS module instead of turning into its own thing.
> Keep the underscore if you rename it.

1. **Copy the host folder**:

   ```bash
   cp -r modules/hosts/Diablo modules/hosts/<yourhostname>
   ```

2. **Generate your own `_hardware.nix`**, replacing the one you just copied:

   ```bash
   sudo nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config > modules/hosts/<yourhostname>/_hardware.nix
   ```

   Delete the Nvidia/Optimus block it copied over unless you're also on an
   Nvidia laptop - `intelBusId`/`nvidiaBusId` are PCI addresses specific to
   my machine, not yours.

3. **Edit `Host.nix`**:
   - Rename `Diablo` to `<yourhostname>` (the `nixosConfigurations` line and
     `networking.hostName`).
   - Swap the `vayori.users` block for your own people. Each entry takes
     `fullName`/`hashedPassword`/`extraGroups`/`shell`/`avatar`/
     `extraPackages` - see
     [docs/core.md](docs/core.md#modulescoreusersnix) for what each field
     does. `mkpasswd -m sha-512` makes the hash.
   - Adjust `vayori.apps` - just a list of app names pulled from
     `modules/apps/{development,gaming,utils}/**/*.nix`. `Host.nix` groups
     them by category for readability, but that's purely cosmetic - it
     flattens to a plain list before anything reads it.
   - Fix up timezone/locale/bootloader further down.

4. **Rebuild**:

   ```bash
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<yourhostname>
   ```

</details>

## Extending it

**Add a person**: another entry in `vayori.users`, in that host's
`Host.nix`. Apps are picked once per *machine*, not per person - everyone
on a host gets the same set.

**Add an app**: drop a folder anywhere under `modules/apps/development/`,
`modules/apps/gaming/`, or `modules/apps/utils/` that sets
`flake.homeModules.apps.<Name>`. That's it - it's now a valid `vayori.apps`
entry automatically. The category folder is just for tidiness; only the
attribute name actually matters.

**Add a language**: drop a folder in `modules/apps/development/languages/`
that sets `flake.homeModules.apps.<Lang>` (the actual packages) and
`flake.devLanguages.<Lang>` (what the editors should install for it - see
[docs/core.md](docs/core.md#modulescoredevlanguagesnix) for the shape they
expect). Add `<Lang>` to `vayori.apps` and every editor picks it up on its
own.

**Add a host**: copy `modules/hosts/Diablo/`, follow
[Using this on your own machine](#using-this-on-your-own-machine).

## Documentation

The `.nix` files are kept comment-free - all the "why" (and the handful of
real gotchas worth knowing before you touch something) lives in `docs/`
instead, split up to match `modules/` so no single file turns into a wall
of text:

| Doc | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) | Index - how it's all wired together, links to everything below |
| [docs/core.md](docs/core.md) | Users, apps, languages, the plugin checker, host/hardware config |
| [docs/desktop.md](docs/desktop.md) | DMS, niri, fonts/portals, the GTK/Qt baseline, matugen templates |
| [docs/system.md](docs/system.md) | Docker/libvirtd, GRUB theming |
| [docs/apps-development.md](docs/apps-development.md) | The three editors, per-language toggles, dev-tools, Free Claude Code |
| [docs/apps-gaming.md](docs/apps-gaming.md) | The gaming setup |
| [docs/apps-utils.md](docs/apps-utils.md) | Zen Browser, Spicetify, Nautilus, Bitwarden, Terminal, Vesktop |

Find the file you're editing, jump to its doc. Worth a read before you
touch `Host.nix`, `Niri.nix`, or `Dms.nix` especially - each has at least
one landmine that won't announce itself until it's already gone off.

## Known caveats

- The `dankAsusControlCenter` widget builds fine but hasn't actually met
  real ASUS hardware yet in testing - see
  [docs/desktop.md](docs/desktop.md#modulesdesktopdmsnix) if `asusctl`/
  `supergfxctl` won't cooperate.
- No license file. Ask before you go redistributing this wholesale.
